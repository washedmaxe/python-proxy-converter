# python-proxy-converter
Small script which allows you to convert proxies (authenticated with username and password)  from .txt files to formatted proxies you can use in your python sneaker bots/scripts ( or whatever else). Also includes a timeout checker, meaning you have the option to only save  and export the proxies with low ping.

1. Have Python & Pip
2. Create a folder and add the file "mychecker.py" with the code in it or clone this repository
3. Create the files "input.txt" & "output.txt" inside the same folder
4. Place your proxies inside "input.txt" - Note: only supports authenticated proxies
5. Open CMD & type "pip install requests"
6. CD in your folder, and start the checker with "python mychecker.py"
7. Export your proxies from the "output.txt" file
